 *      HAVAL is a one-way hashing algorithm with the following
 *      collision-resistant property:
 *             It is computationally infeasible to find two or more
 *             messages that are hashed into the same fingerprint.

 *      This library provides routines to hash
 *        -  a string,
 *        -  a file,
 *        -  input from the standard input device,
 *        -  a 32-word block, and
 *        -  a string of specified length.

 * libpsec Changes by Pedro A. Hortas (06/09/2014)
 *
 * - Converted constants to settings of haval_state, allowing generic API access.
 * - Detect endianess at runtime.
 * - Added configuration options fot digest length and number of passes through hash_set_*() functions
